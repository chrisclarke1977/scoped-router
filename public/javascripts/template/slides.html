<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>We needed a way to create tabbed views, with a configurable number of tabs, and with routes to link directly to a specific tab. We also needed a way to nest tabbed views, and to route directly to any nested tab.</p>

<p>This slideshow is an example of a tabbed view. Below is a nested tabbed view.</p>

<div class="tabset-region">[ insert nest tab view here ]</div>
