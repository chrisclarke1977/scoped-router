		My name is Pascal.
		I’m a frontend developer for about.me,
		which lets you easily make a one-page website all about you and your interests.
		We’ve been migrating our entire product to Backbone and Marionette,
		piece by piece, over the last year.

	<h1>What we wanted to do</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Display Marionette Views in a tabbed interface</li>
		<li>Enable or disable individual tabs <span class="link dynamically">dynamically</span></li>
		<li>Nest tabbed views, infinitely</li>
		<li>Re-show the last active tab when returning to a tabbed view</li>
		<li>Track history and respond appropriately to back/forward buttons</li>
		<li>Link directly link to any tab in the view hierarchy</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="notes">
		We needed a way to display Marionette views in a tabbed user interface,
		with a configurable nav and a region that would be populated
		with a view for each tab.
		
		We needed to be able to enable or disable the tabs dynamically,
		so a tab could be hidden from view under various conditions.

		We also needed to nest multiple levels of tabbed views.
		We didn't need infinite depth, but decided any solution worth its salt
		would be able to handle infinite levels of tabs.
		
		We needed to have routing set up so we can link directly
		to any nested view in the hierarchy.
		
		And that routing should no longer apply if the tabbed view is no longer visible.

		Let's look at the anatomy of a tabbed view.

<script class="apple">
	<h2>Tabs are a Marionette Behavior</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>View provides a tab region</li>
		<li>View can also provide a nav region</li>
		<li>Nav is a collection view</li>
		<li>Default nav view is a button bar</li>
		<li>BYO CSS</li>
	<div class="notes">
		By show of hands, who here knows about Marionette Behaviors?
		If you're not familiar with Marionette Behaviors,
		they are a way to encapsulate some functionality which
		can then be added to any view.
		The view defines a region where the tabs will be shown.
		The view can also define a nav region for the tab navigation.
		The nav view can be any collection of composite view.
		By default, the behavior provides a buttonbar view
		which can by styled any way you like.
		The active tab is marked with an active class.
	</div>
	</ul>
</script>
<script class="banana">
	<h2>A Tab is a Model</h2>
	<ul class="code">
		<li>id: "banana"</li>
		<li>label: "Banana"</li>
		<li>view: any Backbone.View</li>
		<li>viewOptions: (optional)</li>
		<li>visible: true || false</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="notes">
		Each tab has an id, which is also used for routing, which I'll get into later.
		Each tab has label which is shown in the navigation for the tabbed view.
		Each tab has a view which can be any subclass of Backbone.View,
		and viewOptions which are passed to the View class to create a view instance
		each time the tab is shown.
		You can also set the tab's visible property to false to hide it from view.
	</div>

<script class="carrot">
	<h2>A TabList is a Collection</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The View passes an array of tabs<br>to the Tabs behavior</li>
		<li>The Tabs behavior converts the array into a collection</li>
	</ul>
	<pre>
	tabs: [
		{ id: 'apple',  label: 'Apple',  view: AppleView  },
		{ id: 'banana', label: 'Banana', view: BananaView },
		{ id: 'carrot', label: 'Carrot', view: CarrotView }
	]
	</pre>
	<div class="notes">
		The list of tabs is just an array of object literals
		which the view passes in the behavior's options.
		The behavior converts the array into a collection of tab models.

		<li>Start your app</li>
		<li>Instantiate your router(s)</li>
		<li>Router(s) add routes to Backbone.history.handlers array</li>
		<li>Start Backbone.history</li>

<script class="apprunning">
	<h2>While Your App Is Running</h2>

		<li>User navigates around your app</li>
		<li>App updates the URL to reflect the current app state</li>
		<li>User clicks back button</li>
		<li>URL changes, triggering a history event</li>
		<li>Backbone.history finds the most recently added route which matches the current URL and calls its handler</li>

<script class="limitations">
	<h2>Limitations in Backbone Routing</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Routes created after history has started won’t be triggered even if they match the current URL.</li>
		<li>Route handlers must be capable of handling different app states.</li>
		<li>There’s no prescribed way to remove a route from Backbone.history.</li>
		<li>No way for a URL to trigger more than one route handler.</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="notes">
		You can define new routes after history has started, but they won't be triggered until the next time the URL changes. This generally means you have to know in advance all the routes that your application will support. This makes it harder to decentralize route handlers.
		Route handlers have to be able to handle all your different app states. If a route is triggered when it's no longer valid, it has to know not to do anything.
		Routes persist through the life of your application. Suppose the current user logs out. If your app has routes to views that are only visible to logged-in users, why not just remove those routes?
		When the URL changes, there might be several routes that match that new URL, but only the most recently one will be triggered.
