	<h1>What we wanted to do</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Display Marionette Views in a tabbed interface</li>
		<li>Enable or disable individual tabs dynamically</li>
		<li>Nest tabbed views, infinitely</li>
		<li>Re-show the last active tab when returning to a tabbed view</li>
		<li>Link directly link to any tab in the view hierarchy</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="notes">
		<p>We needed a way to display Marionette views in a tabbed user interface, with routing to link directly to a given tab. We also needed to nest multiple levels of tabbed views, with nested routing so we can link directly to any nested view in the hierarchy.</p>
		<p>We also wanted to conditionalize the tabs, so a tab could be marked as invalid and not be shown. The route for an invalid tab should do nothing.</p>
